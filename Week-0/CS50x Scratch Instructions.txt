You play as the Scratch Cat, use the keyboard arrows to move (Ie. Up arrow =  Goes Up) and you must run away from the bear that is chasing you.
You can press "a" to run faster.
Collect the yellow balls to earn points, each time you earn a point, your speed and the bear's will be risen.
Earn 11 points (points > 10) to win the game.
If the bear catches you, the game and the points are reset. (same when you win, but at least there is a cool message)
